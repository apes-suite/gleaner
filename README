This project contains the gleaner module,
which provides functions to process ASCII
files (tracking, timing) of the APES tools
easily in Python scripts.

To use the module, you either need to set
the PYTHONPATH environment variable to
contain the path to gleaner, or install it
into the directory that is searched by default
(i.e. /usr/lib/python).

The "examples" directory contains some examples
on how the gleaner module might be used.
